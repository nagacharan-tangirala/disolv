Disolv stands for **D**ataflow-centric **I**ntegrated **S**imulation **O**f **L**arge scale **V**ANETs.

### What is Disolv?

Disolv is a VANET simulator capable of studying futuristic Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications.
Disolv is designed with the primary goal of supporting large-scale simulations of various ITS scenarios.
For a more conceptual overview and the architecture design decisions, refer to the documentation
at [Disolv-Documentation](https://nagacharan-tangirala.github.io/disolv-docs/).

### Why?

[I am Charan](https://nagacharan.phd) and I am a PhD student at TUM.
My research is in urban mobility simulations and I developed Disolv to assist my research.

### Collaboration

Reach out to me at **nagacharan.tangirala@tum.de** if you are interested in using Disolv for your research.
Or reach out to me if you want to learn more about it.

### Sample Scenarios

Scenarios and the instructions on how to run them are available
at [disolv-scenarios](https://github.com/nagacharan-tangirala/disolv-scenarios).

Disolv stands for **D**ataflow-centric **I**ntegrated **S**imulation **O**f **L**arge scale **V**ANETs.

### What is Disolv?

Disolv is a VANET simulator capable of studying futuristic Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications.
Disolv is designed with the primary goal of supporting large-scale simulations of various ITS scenarios.
For a more conceptual overview and the architecture design decisions, refer to the documentation
at [Disolv-Documentation](https://nagacharan-tangirala.github.io/disolv-docs/).

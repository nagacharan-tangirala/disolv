# Core Module for PAVeNet

This crate has the core functionality for PAVeNet. It contains the simulation engine, the network model, and the
space model. The core functionality of krABMaga is used here and extended to support the simulation of PAVeNet.
This should be independent of the actual scenario. The scenario specific functionality is implemented in the crate 
'pavenet'.
